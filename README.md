## Customize HiiT Workout

The "Customize HiiT Workout" in Lucky Fitness allows users to be able to create a workout consisting of exercises. 

### Key Components

- **Add Exercise**: the users can add any exercise through that button and it will display a message where it went the added exercise went to.
- **Type duration**: the user has to enter any duration of their choice and it will be in minutes
- **Enter HiiT Name:**: the users can be able to name their workout they added.
- **Rest Time (minutes)**: the users can decide to add any rest time they want to for their workouts for in between periods.
- **Your weight**: the users can insert their weight so they can know the estimated calories burnt during their HiiT workout.

### How it Works

As you enter the web application you can go to the exercise page and select any exercise of your choice and you can be able to scroll down and see a button that says "show more exercises" You can click it if you are not satisfied. after adding any exercise of your choice go to the customize HiiT page and input the title of the workout you are creating, the rest time of your choice for your exercise and also you can type in your weight.  after that, you can click the save HiiT button. and you have created a HIIT workout

### Design 

I had a clear vision from the beginning, which made the process manageable. I sketched out the initial design on Figma before starting the implementation. I decided to use portrait size for the exercise interface, differing from the common small box format used in most apps, to give it a unique aspect.
Additionally, I incorporated a rest time feature. Recognizing that every user appreciates breaks during workouts, this seemed like a natural fit to enhance user experience by allowing intervals of rest.
For the weight input feature, I thought it essential for a fitness app to track weight changes, considering that consistent exercise can lead to weight loss. This feature not only aids in tracking health metrics but also motivates users by showing the tangible results of their fitness journey.

## Favourite an exercise of choice

The "Favourite an exercise of choice" feature in Lucky Fitness allows users to bookmark the exercise they like the more and they can see them in the favorites page.

### Key Components

- the user can see a favorite button in a star format

### How it Works

so basically while they are creating their personalized HiiT they can decide to favorite exercise. so it is in any exercise portrait clicking it will do the job and you can view it from your favorite page.

### Design

I believe that integrating these features will enhance the app's appeal and interactivity for users.

## search for an exercise

The "search for an exercise" feature in Lucky Fitness allows users to search for any exercise while creating their HiiT.

### How it Works

Simply enter any exercise into the search bar to find available sessions at any time.

### design 

I decided to integrate this feature because some users may have difficulty scrolling, so typing to create your own HIIT session offers a more accessible alternative.

The " Start a HiiT workout" feature in Lucky Fitness allows users to start the workout they created.

### Key Components

- **Start Button**: The user can start their workout from the get-go.

### How it Works

It's quite straightforward: after creating your HIIT session, simply click 'Save HIIT.' This action will redirect you to the 'Saved-HIIT' page. From there, click 'Start' and you're ready to begin your workout.

### Design
For every workout created, users can easily start their session with the click of a button. I've also implemented detailed instructions for each exercise to guide them effectively. Additionally, to help users stay focused and informed, the app displays real-time updates on current activities and whatâ€™s coming up next.

### Navigation

- The bottom navigation bar includes buttons for quick access to other app features such as "History," "Home," and "MyVault."
